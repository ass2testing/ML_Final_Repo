# California Housing Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict median housing prices in California. It can assist real estate agents, policymakers, and economic researchers in understanding housing market trends.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to predict the median house value for California districts, considering features such as median income, housing age, and location that can influence house prices.

## Data Overview
The dataset comes from the sklearn dataset library and includes demographic and geographic information, along with median house values for districts across California.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Files
- ML_Final_project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and model.

## Usage
To run this project, make sure you have all the required libraries installed, then execute the Jupyter Notebook cell-by-cell to understand the workflow.

## Acknowledgments
This project uses the California Housing dataset available from the sklearn datasets library.
